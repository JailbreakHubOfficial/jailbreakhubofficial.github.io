   "summary": "Learn how to achieve powerful, system-wide ad blocking on your iPhone by sideloading the AdGuard Pro IPA, without needing a jailbreak.",
   "content": "For those seeking powerful, system-wide ad blocking without a jailbreak, the AdGuard Pro IPA is an excellent solution. By using a DNS filter, this app can block ads not just in Safari, but across most applications on your iPhone. Hereâ€™s how you can find and install it.\n\n1. Find the IPA\nNavigate to the Blatant Telegram channel at https://t.me/blatants. From there, find the 'Blatant IPA Library' and search for 'Adguard' to locate the IPA file.\n\n2. Understand the Requirements\nBefore installing, it is critical to know that this IPA requires a paid developer certificate with 'App Groups' enabled. It will not function correctly with a standard, free developer account.\n\n3. What are 'App Groups'?\n'App Groups' is an Apple developer feature that allows different apps from the same developer to share data securely. Think of it as a secure tunnel between the main AdGuard Pro app and its DNS filtering extension. The main app is where you set your rules and blocklists, and the 'App Group' allows it to securely pass those rules to the system-level extension that does the actual ad blocking. This capability is only available to paid Apple Developer accounts, which is why a paid certificate is necessary for the app to function.\n\nOnce properly signed and installed, AdGuard Pro provides one of the most effective ways to enjoy a cleaner, ad-free experience across your entire device."

    "summary": "A look back at the golden era of iOS 11, where devices like the iPhone 8 and the revolutionary iPhone X were jailbreakable with powerful tools like Unc0ver and Electra.",
    "content": "The iPhone 8 and iPhone X, both released with iOS 11, represent a significant chapter in jailbreaking history. For users on this firmware, two primary tools emerged: Electra and the later, more refined Unc0ver. These semi-untethered jailbreaks gave users deep customization options on Apple's A11 Bionic chip. While the checkm8-based Palera1n jailbreak now covers the iPhone 8 and X on much newer iOS versions, the original iOS 11 jailbreaks are a nostalgic reminder of a vibrant period in the community's history."

    "content": "A significant vulnerability has been identified by security researchers within Apple's CoreTrust service, a critical component responsible for signature validation across iOS. The bug, which affects versions up to the current iOS 18 beta, could potentially allow for the bypassing of code signing checks. While a full jailbreak requires chaining multiple exploits, this discovery is a monumental first step. The community is buzzing with excitement, though developers urge patience as much more work is needed to develop a stable, user-friendly tool. This is the most promising lead for a modern jailbreak since the KFD exploit."
