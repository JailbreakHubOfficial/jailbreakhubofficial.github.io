    "summary": "Learn the difference between old 'rootful' and new 'rootless' jailbreaks and why it matters for your tweaks.",
    "content": "Modern jailbreaks are 'rootless' for improved security. Older 'rootful' jailbreaks gave full access to the core system files ('/'), which was powerful but risky. For security, Apple now makes this core system read-only.\n\n'Rootless' jailbreaks work around this by only modifying a safe, separate area (/var/jb). This is much safer, but it means older tweaks must be updated by their developers to work with this new file path. All modern jailbreaks now use the rootless method."

   "content": "The AdGuard Pro IPA offers system-wide ad blocking for non-jailbroken devices. Find it by searching for 'Adguard' in the 'Blatant IPA Library' on the Blatant Telegram channel (https://t.me/blatants).\n\nThis app requires a paid developer certificate to enable 'App Groups,' a feature that lets the main app securely send its filter lists to the system extension that blocks the ads. Free accounts cannot use this feature.\n\nOnce properly signed, AdGuard Pro is one of the best ways to block ads across your entire device."

    "summary": "A look back at the golden era of iOS 11, where devices like the iPhone 8 and the revolutionary iPhone X were jailbreakable with powerful tools like Unc0ver and Electra.",
    "content": "The iPhone 8 and iPhone X, both released with iOS 11, represent a significant chapter in jailbreaking history. For users on this firmware, two primary tools emerged: Electra and the later, more refined Unc0ver. These semi-untethered jailbreaks gave users deep customization options on Apple's A11 Bionic chip. While the checkm8-based Palera1n jailbreak now covers the iPhone 8 and X on much newer iOS versions, the original iOS 11 jailbreaks are a nostalgic reminder of a vibrant period in the community's history."

    "content": "A significant vulnerability has been identified by security researchers within Apple's CoreTrust service, a critical component responsible for signature validation across iOS. The bug, which affects versions up to the current iOS 18 beta, could potentially allow for the bypassing of code signing checks. While a full jailbreak requires chaining multiple exploits, this discovery is a monumental first step. The community is buzzing with excitement, though developers urge patience as much more work is needed to develop a stable, user-friendly tool. This is the most promising lead for a modern jailbreak since the KFD exploit."
