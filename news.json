    "summary": "Learn the quick method to block ads across all apps on your rootless jailbroken iPhone by modifying your hosts file.",
    "content": "Tired of ads on your jailbroken iPhone? You can block them system-wide by modifying your device's `hosts` file. This powerful method prevents your phone from contacting ad servers. Hereâ€™s the quick guide for modern rootless jailbreaks.\n\n**1. Install LetMeBlock**\nFirst, install the essential tweak **LetMeBlock** from PoomSmart's repository (`https://poomsmart.github.io/repo/`) using Sileo or Zebra. This allows your device to read the custom hosts file.\n\n**2. Get the Hosts File**\nIn Safari, go to the **StevenBlack hosts file** on GitHub. For the standard 'Unified hosts' version, tap the blue **'link'** under the 'Raw hosts' column. This opens the raw text file.\n\n**3. Download Correctly**\nUse the Share button and select 'Save to Files'. Before saving, ensure the filename is exactly `hosts` (all lowercase).\n\n**4. Place the File**\nUsing Filza File Manager, copy your downloaded `hosts` file and paste it into this directory: `/var/jb/etc/`.\n\n**5. Reboot to Apply**\nTo activate the changes, perform a **Userspace Reboot** using a tweak like PowerSelector. Alternatively, a standard reboot will also work, but you will need to re-run your jailbreak app afterwards.\n\nEnjoy a cleaner, ad-free experience across all of your apps!"

    "summary": "A look back at the golden era of iOS 11, where devices like the iPhone 8 and the revolutionary iPhone X were jailbreakable with powerful tools like Unc0ver and Electra.",
    "content": "The iPhone 8 and iPhone X, both released with iOS 11, represent a significant chapter in jailbreaking history. For users on this firmware, two primary tools emerged: Electra and the later, more refined Unc0ver. These semi-untethered jailbreaks gave users deep customization options on Apple's A11 Bionic chip. While the checkm8-based Palera1n jailbreak now covers the iPhone 8 and X on much newer iOS versions, the original iOS 11 jailbreaks are a nostalgic reminder of a vibrant period in the community's history."

    "summary": "A newly discovered vulnerability in CoreTrust could pave the way for a jailbreak on Apple's latest OS. Researchers are cautiously optimistic.",
    "content": "A significant vulnerability has been identified by security researchers within Apple's CoreTrust service, a critical component responsible for signature validation across iOS. The bug, which affects versions up to the current iOS 18 beta, could potentially allow for the bypassing of code signing checks. While a full jailbreak requires chaining multiple exploits, this discovery is a monumental first step. The community is buzzing with excitement, though developers urge patience as much more work is needed to develop a stable, user-friendly tool. This is the most promising lead for a modern jailbreak since the KFD exploit."
